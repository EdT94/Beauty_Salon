My mom has a cosmetics treatment business, so I thought I could give her clients another option for booking appointments for the various treatments, not just by phone call.

In order to book the appointment, you must first connect to the system through a Google account, or register manually (currently there is no check for the correctness of the email).

After logging in, the main screen will be displayed:

In addition to the option to book an appointment, there is a contact screen:

In order to book an appointment, it is necessary to first select the date (it will not be possible to choose the desired hour before choosing the date). Then choose the type of treatment and time from the options.

After booking the appointment, it will appear on the main screen, if there are several appointments, they will be sorted by date. After the manager's approval, the icon of the "clock" will disappear, so you can know that the appointment is approved. You can delete the appointment by clicking on the "Trash Can" icon.
